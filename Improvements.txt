UI / UX is very basic
No Graph, historical price data shows up as a Table
Order Page should have info about user balance / stock so it can prevent bad orders from being placed
User Login / Auth
We should store the detailed stock info locally to avoid making a yfinance call every time
We should validate against schema, especiall for db writes
