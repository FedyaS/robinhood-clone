# This is the React App used for the Frontend

## Cool Tech Used
- useNavigate / useLocation for jumping around pages with data persistance
- useContext for userID (in the future can be used for userAuth)
- MUI library for UI

## Improvements
- Typescript
- Adding a chart for stock data
- The Place Order input is a bit wonky
- The view order submit button only works if the content changed (it auto fetches)
